# WBANs_ContikiOS

## Overview

This project utilizes ContikiOS to simulate a football game environment where player vitals are monitored and information is relayed through a network of sensor nodes. The primary goal is to find the optimal configuration of sink nodes to efficiently relay information and ensure reliable tracking of player vitals.

## Requirements

- Cooja Simulator: The ContikiOS simulator used for testing and validating the project. Cooja allows for realistic simulation of sensor nodes and their interactions.

- Python (optional): If you plan to perform data analysis and visualization, you may need Python with libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas.

## Configuration

Adjust simulation parameters, mobility models, and network configurations in the source code to experiment with different scenarios.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find bugs, have suggestions, or want to add new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
